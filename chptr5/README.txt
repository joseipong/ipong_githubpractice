Summary of Chapter 5

Chapter 5 talks about the different distributed Git workflows like the following:
- Centralized workflow - people working with a shared repository
- Integration-Manager workflow - people have access to their own public repository but can only read other people's repository with one repository representing the official project
- Dictator and Lieutenant workflow - integration managers are in charge of certain parts of the repository; the repository of the benevolent dictator is the one where collaborators need to pull. Usually used for large scale projects.

Chapter 5 also talks about contributing to a project, it describes four ways to do that:
In a private team: Pull changes first before pushing your own changes
In a private managed team: People push their branches to the server but only the intergrators can merge it with the master branch
In a forked public project: People clone the repository and then fork it to have your own writable version of the project
In a project over email: People generate email version of each commit

Chapter 5 also talks about managing projects like working in topic branches, applying patches from email, checking out remote branches, integrating contributed work, and releasing.
